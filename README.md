# Customer Segmentation Project

## Problem Statement

As a mall owner, understanding your customers is crucial to tailor marketing strategies effectively. This project aims to identify target customers who are likely to engage more easily and efficiently with your marketing efforts. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means Clustering, we can achieve customer segmentation and provide valuable insights to the marketing team for strategy planning.

## Dataset

We utilized the Customer Segmentation dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python). This dataset contains essential information about customers that we analyze and segment.

## Project Objectives

1. **Customer Segmentation**: We demonstrate how to perform customer segmentation using a machine learning algorithm, specifically K-Means Clustering. This allows us to group customers with similar characteristics together.

2. **Identifying Target Customers**: We identify the target customers who are more likely to be receptive to marketing strategies. This helps optimize marketing campaigns for higher conversion rates.

3. **Real-World Marketing Insights**: We explore how these segmentation insights can be applied in the real world, providing practical applications for marketing strategy development.

## Tools and Technologies

Here are the primary tools and technologies used in this project:

- **Python**: The main programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment where we perform our analysis and develop machine learning models.
- **K-Means Clustering**: The machine learning algorithm used for customer segmentation.
- **Pandas and Numpy**: Libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Used for data visualization.
